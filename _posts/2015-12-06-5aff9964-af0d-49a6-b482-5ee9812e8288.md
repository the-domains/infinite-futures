Blockchain - a future of distributed trust networks - what are the possibilities?

What are all the applications you think blockchain - private, distributed, trust ledgers - could, would, and should have in the future?  What mundane, wild, wonderful uses do you think people will find for blockchain technology?  What impacts will those uses have? What alternative futures for blockchain use might emerge over the next 20 or so years?

Infinite Futures, Vision Foresight Strategy, Cognitive Edge, and B9labs are working together to collect transformative stories about possible futures for blockchain.  We're using Cognitive Edge's [Sensemaker Crowdsensor][0] platform to collect your stories - Crowdsensor lets \*you\* tell us your story, and then tell us what your story means.

Both news media and social networks have been ramping up the amplification of their blockchain buzz.  Why do you think people are so excited about its potential? What do you think are its best - and worst - use cases for the future? Tell us how you think it might be used - and what the implications and impacts of that use will be.  We'll reflect the stories and analysis back to you in early January.

Feel free to use the Crowdsensor collector as many times as you like to share each of the blockchain futures you can imagine.  We will be leaving the Collector open through 31 December.  We will be compiling an interim report on 9 December, and will share the results of that as well.
